2.0.0.0

- Initial release

*NEXT VERSION*

- Improved documentation.
- Added support for `{% elif %}`.
- Fixed some spurious test failures.
- Moved `date` builtin to ginger extensions (its alias, `dateformat`, was
  an extension already).
- Added built-ins:
    - random()
    - min()
    - max()
    - sum()
- Made truthiness checks more lenient, so that things like `{% if [] %}` work
  like in Jinja
